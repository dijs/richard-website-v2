export const bio = 'A software developer since 2006, my engineering roots run all the way back to my childhood, where I could often be found taking things apart to learn how they worked. After graduating from The University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. in Software Engineering, I jumped right into the industry. I have since contributed to projects ranging from desktop PDF editing software to being an architect of a Fortune 100 companyâ€™s e-commerce site, as well as having been employed by a Best Places to Work designee, The Container Store. In addition, I complete contract projects, open source projects and serve as a Senior Platform Engineer at Moovweb. Having found my passions in both applications and web technologies, my work often explores the cutting edge of mobile and desktop browsers and solutions. I also maintain multiple blogs about new technologies, programming language features, artificial intelligence, home automation, and open source technologies.';
